A confident free-spirited person in a leather jacket over a graphic tee, balancing
one foot on a skateboard, windswept hair, wide carefree grin, giving a two-finger

a few small chat bubbles from multiple conversations floating at different distances
in the background to suggest many simultaneous flirtations
```

particles drifting around their knees

A well-adjusted balanced person in neat casual clothes (cardigan over shirt),
relaxed standing pose, holding a coffee cup in one hand and an open paperback in

around the figure as if they were a rare documented species

anger marks floating above the head, eye twitching slightly
```

#### DZNF — 林黛玉 · WILT

A delicate melancholic person in layered soft-hued hanfu-inspired top, seated among
falling cherry blossom petals, tears streaming down both cheeks, clutching a small
embroidered handkerchief to their mouth, head tilted downward in sorrow, long hair
gently wind-blown, a single drooping wilting flower held loosely in their other
hand with petals beginning to fall, the whole posture suggesting a body visibly
wilting under the slightest emotional breeze
```

dreamy atmosphere

### ⚖️ Hidden · 隐藏人格

#### ALL — 我全都要 · ALL

> 小孩子才做选择，而我全都要——然后一个也没得到

```
A wide-grinning greedy young person comically overloaded with every possible
romance archetype at once, arms stretched wide trying to cradle a chaotic
pile of mismatched props — a tiny megaphone, a chess piece, a lit sparkler,
a cactus, a bouquet, a leash, a rose, a phone — all slipping through their
fingers and tumbling to the floor, a crooked golden paper crown reading
"ALL" perched on messy hair, sparkling eyes full of insatiable want, empty
hands at the center of the composition despite the overflowing pile

beanie casting a faint rat-ear shadow, crouched close to the ground near a
metal drain grate, hands shielding a phone with an unsent message draft, a
tiny cartoon rat plushie peeking out of the hoodie pocket, downcast self-
pitying eyes, sunken shoulders, dim alley lighting

silver trim, kneeling on one knee while holding aloft a glowing paper heart

faint golden halo arcing behind the head, soft rose petals drifting upward

A dishevelled person with wild frizzy hair and visible eye-bags, wearing a
crumpled oversized shirt covered in scribbled text fragments, one hand
aggressively thumb-typing on a phone held mid-air, the other gripping a
coffee cup overflowing dramatically, mouth open mid-rant, one eye twitching,
a snowstorm of loose manuscript pages circling them, a faint electric spark
aura crackling around the shoulders
```

#### E-DOG — 赛博舔狗 · E-DOG

> 现实里不认识你，线上我是你亲爹

```
A hunched person sitting cross-legged on a dim bedroom floor, face dully
lit only by phone glow, wearing a cyberpunk hoodie with glowing LED trim,
cartoon dog-ear outlines hovering above the head like a projected AR filter,
a holographic tongue-out dog emoji floating beside their cheek, the phone
showing chat bubbles stuffed with dog emojis, their real expression flat
and exhausted while the screen reflection beams with affection
```

#### CHAOS — 已读乱回 · CHAOS

> 已读。然后我回了一堆颠话

```
A dazed person with tousled hair in a soft sweater worn backward, clutching
a phone showing nonsense emoji-spam chat bubbles, one eye drooping while
the other is wide open, a bewildered half-smile, random floating objects
drifting around them — a lone banana, a broken umbrella, a single sock —
a large "??" thought bubble above the head, slight glitch artifacts
rippling through the air, feet subtly misaligned
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted glitchy lavender #b7a4d1 with soft static noise artifacts`

#### CPU — CPU 恋人 · CPU

> 你一句话能让我 CPU 三天三夜

```
A wide-eyed person with faint smoke trails rising from both ears, a
transparent forehead revealing a glowing red-hot CPU chip with pulsing
circuit traces, both hands gripping their hair in mental overload, a
dropped phone in front of them showing a single unread message, a swirling
whirlwind of tiny text fragments like "did they mean" and "or maybe"
orbiting their head, pupils shaped like loading spinners

A well-dressed but slightly wilted person sitting patiently on a plain
wooden bench, cardigan over a neat shirt, a faded paper name tag pinned
to their chest reading "SPARE", holding a phone with a long scrolling
"在吗" message thread unanswered, a polite patient smile tinged with
resignation, dust motes suggesting long stillness, a tiny cobweb beginning
to form between their shoulder and the bench, hands folded quietly on
their knees
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted dusty beige #cbb89a with a faint wooden bench silhouette`

#### JOKER — 小丑 · JOKER（v0.4 新增 · 全状态可触发）

> 笑着说不在意的人，心里早就塌了

```
A theatrical young person in a stylish purple tailcoat with one lapel pinned
with a tiny comedy mask and the other with a tragedy mask, mid-bow with one
arm swept behind their back like a stage performer taking a curtain call, a
wide dazzling grin that doesn't quite reach their eyes — one eye glinting with
performer's sparkle while the other has a single frozen tear track, holding a
fan of playing cards in one hand with the joker card face-up and slightly
larger than the rest, the other hand holding a phone with a "哈哈哈" message
they just sent while their reflection in the phone screen shows a completely
different expression — mouth downturned, eyes hollow, a faint tear on the
cheek, confetti scraps drifting around their feet like the aftermath of a party
only they attended
```

> 已读不回是生活方式，上线即社死

```
A young person lying face-up on a bare mattress in a dim unfurnished room,
phone placed screen-down on their chest, a hollow "OFFLINE" neon sign faintly
glowing in the window behind them, their eyes open but unfocused staring at
the ceiling, wires from dead chargers coiled loose on the floor, a tiny blue
notification dot on the phone back that has clearly been ignored for days,
a crumpled paper airplane made from an unsent confession letter near the
pillow, one hand hanging off the bed holding a half-eaten instant noodle
cup, expression utterly serene like they have stopped caring about the
vibration they no longer feel
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted muted slate grey #3b4252 with cold blue monitor-glow stripes across the walls and a faint "signal lost" grid pattern`

> 命名注记：`VOID` 曾于 v0.2 为 DRNY（透明人）的英文梗名，后改为 `GHOST`。v0.4 重新起用此名指向全新人格（电子断联户），与 DRNY 无语义关系。请勿混用两者旧 prompt。

#### LIMBO — 意难平学家 · LIMBO（v0.4 新增 · 仅 crush 可解）

> 查岗已成考古学研究，博士后在读

```
A tired scholar-looking person hunched over a cluttered desk at night,
wearing round glasses and a rumpled cardigan, surrounded by printed social
media screenshots pinned to a corkboard like a detective's case wall with
red strings connecting posts, timelines and profile photos of one specific
person, a single candle burning low beside a mug of cold tea, one hand
holding a magnifying glass over a faded Instagram story printout, the
other hand scrolling an endless feed on a phone, the corkboard labelled
"THESIS: WHY DID THEY POST THAT" in slightly crazed handwriting, faint
dark circles under their eyes, a small dream bubble above the head showing
a wedding scene that never happened
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted dusky plum #5a3a5e with faint string-and-pushpin overlay and soft candlelight glow from the lower left`

> 命名注记：`LIMBO` 曾于 v0.3 之前为"骑墙党"的旧代号，v0.3 更名为 `ALL · 我全都要` 后 `LIMBO.webp` 亦随 rename 到 `ALL.webp`。v0.4 重新起用此名指向全新人格（意难平学家），与旧"骑墙党"无语义关系——当年被简单标为"两端打平"的玩家现全部走 ALL，LIMBO 现在专门接"查岗博士后"一类。
