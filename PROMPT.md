## 4. 技术参数


| 平台               | 建议参数                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Midjourney v6.1+ | `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 250 --v 6.1`                                    |
| DALL·E 3         | aspect `1:1`, 尺寸 `1024×1024`，前加 `Create a stylized flat vector illustration...` |
| SDXL             | steps 35, CFG 6, sampler DPM++ 2M Karras；若有 16p-style LoRA 更佳                   |


### 一致性关键（极重要）

1. **用风格参考图**：下载一张官方 16p SVG 转 PNG（如 intj-architect-male），Midjourney 加 `--sref <url>`，DALL·E 以 "in the same illustration style as this reference" 附图。十六张全程用**同一张**参考图。
2. **同一 base prompt**：只替换 subject 段，其余字面不变。
3. **固定风格权重**：MJ `--sw 100–200`；SDXL 用 ControlNet reference-only。
4. **分两轮**：先生四家族各一张（GZNY/GRNY/DZNY/DRNY）校准风格；定调后再批量生剩下十二张。

A young person in a cropped crimson bomber jacket and dark jeans, wild windswept hair,
wide panicked bloodshot eyes with a single welling tear, clutching a lit stick of

a faint red blast cloud curling behind them

```
A sharp stylish woman in a tailored blazer and silk blouse, one hand squeezing a

> 爱得热烈，走得潇洒，鱼塘永远在扩建

```
A confident free-spirited person in a leather jacket over a graphic tee, balancing
one foot on a skateboard, windswept hair, wide carefree grin, giving a two-finger
salute goodbye, a trail of tiny faded hearts drifting behind them like exhaust,
a few small chat bubbles from multiple conversations floating at different distances
in the background to suggest many simultaneous flirtations
```

### 🟡 GR · 隐忍家

#### GRNY — 卑微战士 · DUST

```

particles drifting around their knees

```
A cheerful person in a soft beige hoodie with faux puppy-ear headband, tongue
slightly out in happy panting, holding the loose end of a red leash that trails

invisible tail wag suggested by motion lines
```

their knee, dim spotlight from above

#### GRLF — 正常人 · SANE

> 理论上存在的生物

```
A well-adjusted balanced person in neat casual clothes (cardigan over shirt),
relaxed standing pose, holding a coffee cup in one hand and an open paperback in

serene and composed, with a very faint scientific-specimen-label style frame
around the figure as if they were a rare documented species

anger marks floating above the head, eye twitching slightly
```

#### DZNF — 林黛玉 · WILT

> 风吹一下我就能哭半小时

```
A delicate melancholic person in layered soft-hued hanfu-inspired top, seated among
falling cherry blossom petals, tears streaming down both cheeks, clutching a small
embroidered handkerchief to their mouth, head tilted downward in sorrow, long hair
gently wind-blown, a single drooping wilting flower held loosely in their other
hand with petals beginning to fall, the whole posture suggesting a body visibly
wilting under the slightest emotional breeze
```

#### DZLY — 刺猬 · OUCH

> 别靠近我！……你怎么真走了？

```
A prickly-looking person with spiky tousled hair in an oversized studded denim
jacket covered in metallic thorns, arms crossed defensively across the chest, a

visible peeking out between the jacket spikes on their chest
```

afternoon light

#### DRNY — 透明人 · GHOST

> 我的存在感和我的安全感一样低

```
A quiet muted person in a plain grey hoodie standing in a slightly hunched posture,

eyes downcast, clutching a phone close to the chest showing an unsent message draft,
soft thin outline only, very restrained palette
```

dreamy atmosphere
```

#### DRLY — 仙人掌 · DRY

> 三年浇一次水就够了

eyebrow, faint prickly aura lines radiating from their shoulders, dry sun-bleached
background

> 看到了。然后呢？

```
An apathetic person slouching in a grey oversized hoodie, wearing large noise-
cancelling over-ear headphones, holding a phone loosely with a visible "Read"

gaze drifting past the camera, hands-in-pocket energy
```

### ⚖️ Hidden · 隐藏人格

#### ALL — 我全都要 · ALL

> 小孩子才做选择，而我全都要——然后一个也没得到

```
A wide-grinning greedy young person comically overloaded with every possible
romance archetype at once, arms stretched wide trying to cradle a chaotic
pile of mismatched props — a tiny megaphone, a chess piece, a lit sparkler,
a cactus, a bouquet, a leash, a rose, a phone — all slipping through their
fingers and tumbling to the floor, a crooked golden paper crown reading
"ALL" perched on messy hair, sparkling eyes full of insatiable want, empty
hands at the center of the composition despite the overflowing pile
```

> 鼠鼠我啊，连点赞都不敢按下去

```
A small hunched figure in an oversized drab grey hoodie pulled low, a knit
beanie casting a faint rat-ear shadow, crouched close to the ground near a
metal drain grate, hands shielding a phone with an unsent message draft, a
tiny cartoon rat plushie peeking out of the hoodie pocket, downcast self-
pitying eyes, sunken shoulders, dim alley lighting
```

#### PURE — 纯爱战士 · PURE

> 只要真爱还在，废就废得值得

```
A resolute young person in a modern white knight-inspired long coat with
silver trim, kneeling on one knee while holding aloft a glowing paper heart
like a sacred lantern, eyes wet with idealistic conviction, chin lifted
toward an unseen light source, a single red rose pinned to their chest, a
faint golden halo arcing behind the head, soft rose petals drifting upward
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted warm ivory #f5ebd0 with a soft golden halo glow`

#### MAD — 发疯文学家 · MAD

> 我真的要疯了，不是比喻

```
A dishevelled person with wild frizzy hair and visible eye-bags, wearing a
crumpled oversized shirt covered in scribbled text fragments, one hand
aggressively thumb-typing on a phone held mid-air, the other gripping a
coffee cup overflowing dramatically, mouth open mid-rant, one eye twitching,
a snowstorm of loose manuscript pages circling them, a faint electric spark
aura crackling around the shoulders
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted fevered crimson #c73e3e with torn paper scraps swirling`

#### E-DOG — 赛博舔狗 · E-DOG

> 现实里不认识你，线上我是你亲爹

```
A hunched person sitting cross-legged on a dim bedroom floor, face dully
lit only by phone glow, wearing a cyberpunk hoodie with glowing LED trim,
cartoon dog-ear outlines hovering above the head like a projected AR filter,
a holographic tongue-out dog emoji floating beside their cheek, the phone
showing chat bubbles stuffed with dog emojis, their real expression flat
and exhausted while the screen reflection beams with affection
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background split: deep midnight navy #1e2344 on the left, soft pink screen glow #e8a5c8 on the right`

#### CHAOS — 已读乱回 · CHAOS

> 已读。然后我回了一堆颠话

```
A dazed person with tousled hair in a soft sweater worn backward, clutching
a phone showing nonsense emoji-spam chat bubbles, one eye drooping while
the other is wide open, a bewildered half-smile, random floating objects
drifting around them — a lone banana, a broken umbrella, a single sock —
a large "??" thought bubble above the head, slight glitch artifacts
rippling through the air, feet subtly misaligned
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted glitchy lavender #b7a4d1 with soft static noise artifacts`

#### CPU — CPU 恋人 · CPU

> 你一句话能让我 CPU 三天三夜

```
A wide-eyed person with faint smoke trails rising from both ears, a
transparent forehead revealing a glowing red-hot CPU chip with pulsing
circuit traces, both hands gripping their hair in mental overload, a
dropped phone in front of them showing a single unread message, a swirling
whirlwind of tiny text fragments like "did they mean" and "or maybe"
orbiting their head, pupils shaped like loading spinners
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted overheated amber #e07a2b with faint circuit trace patterns`

#### BENCH — 备胎之王 · BENCH

> 在鱼塘边上坐成雕像

```
A well-dressed but slightly wilted person sitting patiently on a plain
wooden bench, cardigan over a neat shirt, a faded paper name tag pinned
to their chest reading "SPARE", holding a phone with a long scrolling
"在吗" message thread unanswered, a polite patient smile tinged with
resignation, dust motes suggesting long stillness, a tiny cobweb beginning
to form between their shoulder and the bench, hands folded quietly on
their knees
```

> Family color cue 替换为：`, background tinted dusty beige #cbb89a with a faint wooden bench silhouette`

### Sticker 技术参数微调


| 平台               | 微调建议                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Midjourney v6.1+ | 在主卡参数基础上追加 `--ar 1:1 --stylize 200`，`--sref` 沿用同一张 16p 参考图                   |
| DALL·E 3         | 提示词开头加 "A small sticker-sized editorial character illustration..."           |
| SDXL             | 构图提示 `"centered bust up, subtle die-cut sticker border, neutral background"` |


> **命名建议**：资源文件统一放在 `src/assets/portraits/`，和四字母主卡（`GZNY.webp` / `ALL.webp` 等大写代号命名）同目录。贴纸文件名统一用 `sticker-<kebab-case>.webp` 前缀区分，既不需要新开目录也不会和主卡混淆。注意本项目历史上还存在一个 `src/assets/16p/` 目录，那是 MBTI 的 SVG 遗留物，**与 FWTI 贴纸无关，不要往里放任何东西**。
